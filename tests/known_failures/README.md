# Known failures

Minimal repros for bugs that are currently OPEN. Each is described in
[../../docs/BUGS.md](../../docs/BUGS.md).

These files are deliberately **outside** the `tests/conformance/conf_*.kry`
glob, so `run_conformance.sh` stays a real signal rather than a suite with
expected-red entries in it. Run them by hand:

    kryos run tests/known_failures/NAME.kry                                  # Cranelift
    kryos build tests/known_failures/NAME.kry --release --backend llvm -o /tmp/x && /tmp/x

When one is fixed, fold it into the conformance test it belongs to and delete
the file here.

| File | Bug |
|---|---|
| `spawn_loop_capture.kry` | Cranelift reuses one box for a loop-local aggregate captured by `spawn`, so every thread observes the last iteration's value. LLVM AOT is correct. Expected `0 10 20 30` in some order; Cranelift prints `30 30 30 30`. |
