# Changelog

All notable changes to Kryos will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Parser struct-literal ambiguity: `match TK_EOF { ... }` no longer parsed as struct literal
- Struct field access segfaults: structs now heap-allocated (malloc) instead of stack slots
- String match patterns: `match s { "hello" => ... }` now emits equality-comparison chain instead of integer switch
- Tail expression return: functions ending with bare `match`/`if` now implicitly return the result
- String concatenation with non-string operands: automatic coercion via `coerce_to_string()` helper
- Double-free prevention: `dropped_locals` tracking prevents nested scope re-drops
- ComptimeBlock type inference: `comptime { expr }` now infers correct result type

### Added
- 4 new example programs: calculator, word_count, json_counter, all_features showcase
- String pattern matching in match expressions (via BinOp::Eq chain with Branch terminators)
- Implicit return for tail expressions in non-void functions

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- 21-crate Rust compiler (49,000+ lines)
- Dual backends: Cranelift (fast debug builds) and LLVM (optimized release builds)
- Ownership-based memory safety without lifetime annotations
- Compile-time capability enforcement (deny-by-default resource access)
- Compile-time evaluation with `comptime` blocks
- Type inference with explicit annotations where needed
- Pattern matching with integer, string, enum, and wildcard patterns
- Dynamic dispatch via `dyn Trait` (vtable-based)
- Generics with monomorphization
- Concurrency: `spawn`, typed channels, actors, `select`
- 5 MIR optimization passes: constant folding, dead code elimination, function inlining, tail-call optimization, strength reduction
- 28 standard library modules (strings, math, collections, I/O, networking, crypto, JSON, regex, datetime, tensors, agents, probability, reactive streams)
- Ergonomic builtins: `file_read`, `file_write`, `env_get`, `time_now`, `assert`, `parse_int`, `parse_float`, `type_of`
- Error handling with `try`/`catch`/`throw`
- VS Code extension with syntax highlighting, snippets, and language configuration
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) server
- Code formatter (`kryos fmt`)
- Documentation generator (`kryos doc`)
- Package manager (`kryos pkg`)
- Test runner (`kryos test`)
- Interactive REPL (`kryos repl`)
- C header binding generator (`kryos bindgen`)
- Native tensor runtime with 38 FFI operations
- GitHub Actions CI (build, test, clippy, fmt on Linux and Windows)
- 13 example programs
- 15-chapter language manual
- 680+ tests, all passing
