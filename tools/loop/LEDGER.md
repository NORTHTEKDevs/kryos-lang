# Kryos production ledger

The queue survives context loss; a session does not. Update this file in the
SAME commit as the work. Anything not written here is lost.

Ranked by SERIOUSNESS FOR THE INTENDED USE CASE, not by which gate is red.
Kryos is deployed as capability-attenuated infrastructure for agent tooling,
so: (breaks the capability/trust model) > (silent wrong answer) > (blocks a
green CI) > (leak) > (papercut). A silent wrong answer outranks a crash — a
crash announces itself. A trust-model hole outranks both: nothing above it in
the stack can be sound if the boundary leaks.

## THE LOOP

```
preflight -> select -> REPRODUCE -> bisect -> fix -> prove -> gate -> push -> ledger
```

Run `tools/loop/kryos-loop.sh preflight` first, every time. Then:

1. **SELECT** the top unblocked item below.
2. **REPRODUCE** before forming any hypothesis. `kryos-loop.sh repro <file>`.
   *No theory is allowed before a reproduction exists.* Three attributions were
   wrong this way in one session — the `@copy` arm, a "merge interaction", and
   the `param_src` branch — each from reading code instead of measuring it.
3. **BISECT MECHANICALLY.** Commit-level (`git cherry-pick` onto a worktree) or
   program reduction (cut the input until the symptom vanishes). Never
   hand-edit a hypothesis in and call the result evidence: one such edit
   silently removed more than intended and produced a confident wrong answer.
4. **FIX.**
5. **PROVE BOTH WAYS.** The test must FAIL without the fix. A gate that cannot
   fail is not a gate. Verified in both directions or it does not count.
6. **GATE** with `kryos-loop.sh gates 3`.
7. **PUSH IMMEDIATELY.** 12 commits sat unpushed once and a second agent
   independently reimplemented one of the fixes.
8. **LEDGER** — record the outcome *and everything ruled out*.

### Non-negotiables

- A self-reported "fixed" is not evidence. Only fresh command output is.
- Every gate can be green while data is silently wrong — that exact thing
  happened here (an `@copy` corruption passed conformance, no_double_free,
  bootstrap, examples, strict-caps, the e2e gate AND the IR gate). When a fix
  touches ownership, add a **value assertion**, not just a crash check.
- Measure leaks at two scales. One number proves nothing.
- Backends agreeing means the defect is in MIR; diverging means read the IR.

## OPEN — ranked

### 2b. NEW (found while closing #2): global-reassignment-then-cross-function-read corrupts an array
`tests/known_failures/global_array_reassign_corrupt.kry` (repro below).
Isolated minimal repro, nothing to do with self-host:
```
struct Item { v: i64 }
let mut G: [Item] = []
fn reset() { let empty: [Item] = []  G = empty }
fn add_one(n: i64) { let it = Item{v:n}  G = push(G, it) }
fn main() { reset()  add_one(1)  println(to_string(len(G))) }
```
`kryos build --release` then run: `kryos panic: kryos_array_push: corrupt
array header ... (len=0, cap=0, elem_size=8, ref_count=1, data=0x0)`. A
top-level `let mut [T]` global works fine when only ever WRITTEN via `push`
from one call chain starting at its own initializer (proven: the same test
minus `reset()`/the extra function hop is flat). It breaks specifically when
one function REASSIGNS the global to a fresh value and a DIFFERENT function
later reads/pushes it -- the reader sees an all-zero header, i.e. either the
global's storage slot isn't actually being written by the cross-function
store, or the reader is loading a stale/wrong slot. Not yet root-caused
(stage-0 LLVM codegen for global stores, not self-host) -- lexer.kry's fix
below works around it by only ever pushing into `LEX_TOKENS`, never
reassigning it after its own top-level initializer. Worth a real fix; until
then avoid "reset a global from a helper function" as a pattern.

### 3. Struct-argument leak — ~86MB per 1M calls
`tests/mem/struct_arg_leak.kry`. Passing a struct with HEAP FIELDS across any
call boundary leaks its body. **Not** method-specific — a free function leaks
identically (that correction is measured; the older "method receiver" framing
was wrong). Flat for contrast: scalar-only struct through a method, and the
same struct's fields read directly. Needs the receiver/box representation work;
7 incremental attempts have failed, so treat it as a design change.



### 4. `comptime { }` runs at RUNTIME while the docs sell compile-time
Fix the docs (hours). Real compile-time evaluation is months and should not
gate 1.0.

### 5. `[dyn Handler]` reports a confusing `E0100` instead of `E0110`
Array-literal element unification ignores the annotated `dyn` element type.

### 6. Docs status sections drift because they are hand-maintained
`docs/BUGS.md` said "none currently tracked" while two tests deadlocked.
Generate from real test output.

### 7. `Parser` has the same array-in-a-rebuilt-struct pattern as the closed lexer bug, unfixed
`self-host/parser.kry`'s `advance()`-style helpers rebuild `Parser { tokens:
p.tokens, pos: p.pos + 1, errors: ..., no_struct_lit: ... }` on every token
consumed (parser.kry:148, 176, 185) -- the same shape that made `Lexer`
balloon to 16GB (closed item #2 below), just at TOKEN granularity (~20030
reconstructions x up to ~20030 retained Token elements) instead of CHARACTER
granularity (~110K reconstructions), so it costs ~O(n^2) but stays in the
"slow, not lethal" range at current file sizes -- measured 286MB peak WS
compiling parser.kry end-to-end post-fix (tokenize alone is <100MB; the
remainder is almost certainly this). Not a crash today, but the same class
of bug and will get worse as self-host files grow. Same fix shape applies:
pull `tokens` out of `Parser` into a read-only pass-through (it's never
mutated after `parser_new`, so this one doesn't even need a module global --
a plain extra parameter threaded through, or confirm `errors`/`no_struct_lit`
don't need the same treatment).

## CLOSED — with the evidence that closed it

| Item | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| sret fn-value ABI | struct through a fn value returned garbage on `--release`; fixed by consulting `func_sig_aggs`. Guessing from the LLVM type string broke `Result.and_then` — enums are aggregate-shaped but returned directly |
| `bool` -> builtin ABI | `json_bool(false)` built JSON `true`; `i1` against an `(i64)` declaration left the upper 63 bits undefined |
| narrow-int args | same class for `char_from`/`char_at`; latent only because 32-bit x86-64 ops zero the upper half |
| read-only builtin args leaked | 15 builtins missing from the borrow allowlist; the consume mark is path-insensitive so one `to_upper(s)` suppressed the drop on every path. 78MB/800k -> flat |
| network `KryosString` allocator | six sites freed under a layout they were never allocated with; 360k TCP round trips 18.7MB -> 0.1MB |
| computed string -> user fn leaked | 35.4MB/400k -> 4.0MB; needed the `@copy` str-field copy as prerequisite |
| `-g` emitted an undefined string global | `kryos build -g` was broken on every platform |
| spawn wrapper `byval` ABI | System V only; closed both concurrency blockers |
| **Cranelift shared one box for a loop-local enum captured by `spawn`** | `tests/known_failures/spawn_loop_capture.kry` (now folded into `tests/conformance/conf_spawn_agg_capture_abi.kry` section 7) -- JIT printed `30 30 30 30`, AOT printed the four distinct values. Suspected mechanism (hoisted per-iteration box) was WRONG -- `--emit-mir` showed a fresh `Msg::variant#0(_3)` every iteration and `RValue::EnumVariant` codegen `kryos_calloc`s a new box each time, both correct. Real cause: the Cranelift `Instruction::Spawn` arg-store match had clone/dup arms for Str/Array/Map/Function/Shared/Struct but no `MirType::Enum` arm, so an enum capture fell to `_ => val` (raw shared pointer, no clone) while MIR's normal post-spawn `drop(_N)` still fired (spawn's documented contract is that it clones heap args) -- freeing the box while the spawned thread could still read it, and the freed slot was immediately reused by the next iteration's same-size `kryos_calloc`, so a thread that lost the race read whichever iteration's value last occupied that address. LLVM AOT already had a `MirType::Enum` arm in its equivalent path, hence no divergence there. Fix: added the missing arm calling the existing `emit_enum_deep_copy` helper (already used for closure/struct captures), mirroring the `MirType::Struct` arm immediately above it. Proof: pre-fix binary crashes (`rc=132`, illegal instruction) on the new value-assertion section every run (5/5); post-fix binary passes 8/8 JIT + 3/3 AOT, and 15/15 raw JIT runs of the original repro now print `0 10 20 30` (was nondeterministic, dominated by `30 30 30 30`). Gates green: conformance 47/47, tier1+tier2 green, bootstrap 16/16 |
| **struct `str` field read leaked, 614MB in CI** | `r.name = mk_str(i)` + `len(r.name)` in a loop: 157.7MB/2M before, 3.9MB after; the full CI workload 617.6MB -> 4.5MB. A `str` field read RETAINS and nothing balanced it. Array/map/struct field reads stay borrows -- `push` grows the shared buffer in place, so dropping those temps is the `alloc_node` double-free |
| **raw-memory capability escape** | a zero-capability program read `TOPSECRET-APIKEY` via `str_to_ptr`+`ptr_byte_at` and dereferenced +4096 without faulting. Closed with a trusted-computing-base split: raw memory requires `ffi` at DIRECT USE in user code and the requirement does not propagate, so the stdlib (which is built on these — `alloc` in 14 modules) stays usable. Guarded by `tests/security_gate.sh`, which asserts BOTH directions plus no-cascade |
| **bootstrap WINDOWS-ONLY exit -1 in tokenize (ex-item #2)** | NOT a fault, not Defender, not the pool allocator, not heap corruption -- confirmed by an `atexit`-hook diagnostic (`KRYOS_EXIT_TRACE=1` in fault.rs) that never fires before the -1 death, proving no `process::exit`/normal `main` return is involved; the OS kills the process directly (memory-pressure dependent). Root cause found by MEASURING MEMORY, not tracing exceptions: `Get-Process` polling showed kryos-stage1.exe peaking at 13-16GB+ (and still climbing) to tokenize a 109KB file. Cause: `Lexer { src, pos, tokens }` was rebuilt via a fresh struct LITERAL on every `lex_advance`/`lex_match_char`/`lex_emit` call (i.e. per CHARACTER, ~110K times for parser.kry, not per token) and `emit_aggregate_struct` in kryos-codegen-llvm clones/dups ANY array-typed struct FIELD unconditionally at every literal construction (elem_kind=4 for a struct-of-Token element additionally RETAINS every element) -- so each of ~110K reconstructions retained up to ~20K already-emitted tokens: O(n^2), order 1e9 atomic retains, matching the CPU hot-path symbols found via `llvm-symbolizer` against a `-g` debug rebuild (`kryos_struct_retain`/`kryos_array_dup`/`kryos_array_new` dominated `KRYOS_WATCHDOG` RVA samples). The EARLIER "Lexer NOT @copy" fix (see struct comment history) assumed a non-@copy struct's array field is merely SHARED (refcount bump) on rebuild; it is not -- `emit_aggregate_struct`'s field-clone is unconditional, not @copy-gated, so that fix never actually delivered the intended O(n) it documented. FIX: pulled `tokens` out of `Lexer` entirely into a module-level `let mut LEX_TOKENS: [Token] = []`, mutated only via `push` (never reassigned after its own initializer -- see item #2b, a SEPARATE newly-found bug where cross-function global reassignment corrupts the array). Proof: peak working set 13-16GB+ -> 286MB (tokenize alone <100MB); dose-response gone -- 8/8 clean on parser.kry (109KB) AND 8/8 clean on lower.kry (128KB, the other historically-failing file) with the OLD binary confirmed still failing 3/6 on lower.kry in the same session (prove-both-ways); `test_bootstrap.sh` 16/16 across 7 consecutive runs (was the documented 14/16 baseline); full `kryos-loop.sh gates 2` GREEN. Item #7 below is the SAME bug class, unfixed, in `Parser` (lower severity: token-granularity not character-granularity, not yet lethal) |

## CAPABILITY SURFACE AUDIT (2026-07-29)

Enumerated all 157 builtins the LLVM codegen maps against the 82 the capability
model gates, filtered to authority-bearing names, and probed each survivor.

- **Raw memory — REAL ESCAPE, fixed.** See the closed table.
- `file_append` — looked ungated to a first-pass grep; it is gated, just in a
  different match arm than `append_file`. No gap.
- `buf_get_byte` / `buf_set_byte` — probed for out-of-bounds access. **Safe:**
  the runtime bounds-checks and returns `-1`. My first probe appeared to show a
  4096-byte over-read only because it counted the `-1` sentinel as data. Verify
  the VALUES, not just that something came back.
- `buf_write_*` — write into an owned buffer, no external authority.
- `read_line`, `time_now_*` — input and clock reads; ambient by design, matching
  the documented model.

**Minor wart, not security:** `buf_get_byte` returns `-1` out of range while
array/string indexing PANICS. Same undocumented-sentinel class as `pop([])`
returning `0`. Inconsistent, and `-1` is a plausible real byte value in signed
contexts. Worth unifying.

---

## MEASUREMENT TRAPS (each cost real time)

- **`cargo build -p kryos-cli` leaves the staticlibs stale.** Runtime edits are
  invisible to AOT programs until a full `cargo build --release`. This produced
  a wrong "no effect" reading and a wrongly "ruled out" theory. `preflight`
  checks it.
- **Bootstrap fails spuriously (rc=127, rotating modules) under load.** Run it
  alone; only a solo failure is real.
- **A control that changes the workload proves nothing.** A server that accepts
  and sends without READING looked perfectly flat — 3965 of 4000 requests were
  failing with RST.
- **`KRYOS_FREE_DIAG=1` completing while the program normally crashes means the
  crash IS corruption.** Master's `parse_int: invalid numeric input: '}'` was
  memory corruption, not a parse bug.
- **A leak needs a workload that ALLOCATES A FRESH VALUE each iteration.**
  Re-reading the SAME string 2M times looks perfectly flat even with a fully
  unbalanced retain -- the refcount climbs, nothing allocates. That false
  reading is what retired the field-read drop and cost 614MB in CI for two
  days. Vary the value, and measure the read and the overwrite TOGETHER: read
  alone 4.3MB, store alone 4.4MB, store+read 157.7MB. Either half alone
  says "no leak".
- **`kryos_string_clone` is not a deep copy.** It is a refcount bump returning
  the same pointer, identical to `kryos_string_retain`.
